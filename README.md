# spine_generic

Description of the publicly-available database and processing pipeline for the "spine generic protocol" project.

## Data collection and organization

The "Spine Generic" MRI acquisition protocol is available at [this link](https://osf.io/tt4z9/). If your site is interested in participating in this publicly-available database, please contact Julien Cohen-Adad for details. 

To facilitate the collection of data, we use the [BIDS standard](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/). Each proprietary DICOM data should be converted to NIFTI format using [dcm2niix](https://www.nitrc.org/plugins/mwiki/index.php/dcm2nii:MainPage) with option to output JSON file alongside each NIFTI file. Each participant is expected to provide a zip file containing the following data shown below. To facilitate the conversion from DICOM folder to BIDS dataset, people can use the [convert_dcm2nii](https://github.com/neuropoly/bids_neuropoly) script.

Where contrast={"T1w", "T2w", "T2star", "dwi", "MT", "PD"}
Note, the fields listed below are the mandatory fields. It is fine to have more fields. E.g., if you use `dcm2niix` you will likely have more entries. EchoTime and RepetitionTime are in seconds.
```

	"EchoTime": 0.06,

	"ConversionSoftwareVersion": "v1.0.20170130 (openJPEG build)",
}
```

### Ethics and anonymization

Each subject consented to be scanned and to have their anonymized data put in a publicly-available repository. To prove it, an email from each participant should be sent to the manager of the database (Julien Cohen-Adad). The email should state the following: "I am the subject who volunteered and I give you permission to release the scan freely to the public domain."

Anatomical scans where facial features are visible (T1w) could be "defaced" before being collected (at the discretion of the subject). To do so, [FreeSurfer's mri_deface](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/mri_deface ) could be used.

## Example datasets (WIP)

We provide two example datasets:
- Multi-center, single-subject
- [Multi-center, multi-subjects](https://osf.io/76jkx/)

## Analysis pipeline

The analysis pipeline available in this repository enables to output the following metrics (organized per contrast):

- **T1**: Spinal cord CSA averaged between C2 and C3.
- **T2**: Spinal cord CSA averaged between C2 and C3.
- **T2s**: Gray matter CSA averaged between C3 and C4.
- **DWI**: FA in WM averaged between C2 and C5.
- **MTS**: MTR in WM averaged between C2 and C5. Uses MTon_MTS and MToff_MTS.
- **MTS**: MTSat & T1 map in WM averaged between C2 and C5. Uses MTon_MTS, MToff_MTS and T1w_MTS.

### Dependencies

In its current state, this pipeline uses [SCT development version](https://github.com/neuropoly/spinalcordtoolbox#install-from-github-development). Once the pipeline is finalized, a stable version of SCT will be associated with this pipeline and indicated here. For now, please use the latest development version of SCT.

This pipeline also relies on [FSLeyes](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSLeyes) for quality control (QC).

### How to run

- Download (or `git clone`) this repository.
- Go to this repository: `cd spine_generic`
- Copy the file `parameters_template.sh` and rename it as `parameters.sh`.
- Edit the file `parameters.sh` and modify the variables according to your needs.
- Process data: `./run_process.sh process_data.sh`
